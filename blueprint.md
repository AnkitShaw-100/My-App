# Project Blueprint: Periodic Bell and Timetable Reminder App

## Overview

This document outlines the development plan for a Flutter application that serves as a periodic bell and timetable reminder. The application will provide timely audio and visual cues for scheduled events or classes, helping users stay on track with their daily routines.

## Current Request: Initial Setup and Splash Screen

### Plan

1.  **Create a Splash Screen:**
    *   The splash screen will have a black background.
    *   It will feature a "bell" icon with a green and blue gradient.
    *   The bell icon will have a simple animation for 5 seconds.
    *   After 5 seconds, the app will navigate to the main home screen.

2.  **Create a Home Screen:**
    *   A placeholder home screen will be created as the destination after the splash screen.

3.  **Update Application Entry Point:**
    *   The `main.dart` file will be updated to launch the splash screen.

### Design and Feature Outline

*   **Splash Screen:**
    *   **Background:** Solid black.
    *   **Animation:** A bell icon that animates for 5 seconds.
    *   **Color Scheme:** The bell icon will have a green and blue gradient.
*   **Home Screen:**
    *   A basic scaffold with a title.
*   **Navigation:**
    *   Automatic navigation from the splash screen to the home screen after a 5-second delay.
